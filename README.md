## Repository for active IETF v6ops WG draft located [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-v6ops-ula/). 

### Summary: 

The behavior of ULA addressing as defined by RFC672 is preferred below legacy IPv4 addressing, thus rendering ULA IPv6 deployment functionally unusable in IPv4 / IPv6 dual-stacked environments. This behavior is counter to the operational behavior of GUA IPv6 addressing on nearly all modern operating systems that leverage a preference model based on RFC6724.
